;;;Program to print Fibonacci series up to given number
;WORKS sort of, recursive version which prints the nth number

(define (fibonacci num)
  ;If number is less then or = 2, display 1

      ;Otherwise fibonacci starts with num - 2
      ; then add that to fibonacci = num - 1
      ; until it is num is reached
